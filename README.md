# CTF Pilot's Discord Bot

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This Discord bot is still in pre-release alpha stage, and is actively being worked on to make it stable.  
> This means that the bot may act in unexpected ways, and not be secure.

CTF Pilot's Discord Bot is a Discord bot, designed to integrate into a challenge repository, allowing for developers to manage challenges directly from Discord.

## Overview

The Discord Bot accelerates CTF challenge development, by turning Discord into a challenge management and bootstrapping tool. Each challenge lives as an issue enriched with labels (Category, Difficulty, base `Challenge`), optional milestone, and optional Projects status field. Channels can be mapped to issues for contextual operations (e.g. updating status or difficulty without re-typing numbers).

## Key Features

- Slash command interface.
- Challenge creation with category, difficulty, status, and milestone.
- Automatic label provisioning to the target challenge repository.
- GitHub Projects integration (status field assignment via GraphQL).
- Repository issue workflow dispatch support (trigger actions/workflows), letting GitHub Actions handle further automation.
- Channel-to-issue linkage and metadata retrieval.
- Role-based access control for sensitive commands.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

In order to run the bot, you need to have:

- A Discord bot token with appropriate permissions (applications.commands, bot with message read/send).
- A GitHub Fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) with `content`, `issues`, `pull requests`, `projects` and `actions` with read and write.
- A target GitHub repository (e.g. `ctfpilot/ctfd-challenges`).
- Target repository has the challenge scaffolding GitHub Actions workflow located at `.github/workflows/create-chall.yml`, if using workflow dispatch.
- (Optional) A milestone name to apply to new issues.
- (Optional) A GitHub Projects v2 numeric project ID (not node ID).

### Docker Compose (recommended)

To run the bot using Docker Compose, first copy the example environment file and fill in the required values.
Then build and start the container:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # Edit and fill in required values
touch challenge_issues.json  # Persistent mapping file

# Start the bot
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

A production Docker Compose file is available at `docker-compose.prod.yml`, which uses the latest released image.
Deploy it using:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Issue -> channel mapping persistence is achieved by mounting a volume:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./challenge_issues.json:/app/challenge_issues.json
```

*`challenge_issues.json` must be created before starting the container, otherwise the bot will fail to start.*

#### Docker image

A [Docker image](https://github.com/ctfpilot/discord-bot/pkgs/container/discord-bot) is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry for each release.  
You can pull the latest image with:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/ctfpilot/discord-bot:latest
```

*For the versions available, please see the [releases page](https://github.com/ctfpilot/discord-bot/releases).*

### Local (Python)

In order to run the bot locally for development or testing, create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the bot with the required parameters:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
python src/main.py \
  --token "$DISCORD_TOKEN" --guild "$DISCORD_GUILD_ID" \
  --gh-token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" --gh-repo "$GITHUB_REPO" \
  --categories "web,crypto,pwn,misc" \
  --difficulties "easy,medium,hard" \
  --project-id 7 --status "Idea,Todo,In Progress,In Review,Done" \
  --allowed-roles "123456789012345678" \
  --milestone "CTF 2025" --verbose
```

*The bot requires Python 3.10+.*

## Configuration

Environment may be set via `.env`, Docker, or CLI flags. Required core variables must be present before startup or the bot exits early.

## Command Reference

All commands are slash commands. Authorization requires the invoking member to have at least one role ID in `DISCORD_ALLOWED_ROLES` and be in the configured guild.

- `/challenges [status] [page]`: Paginated list (10 per page) filtered by issue state (all/open/closed) or project board status.
- `/challenge`
  - `create`: Create challenge
    - `issue [name] [category] [difficulty] [status]`: Create challenge issue, and link it to the current channel
    - `code [issue_number] [name] [author] [category] [difficulty] [challenge_type] [instanced_type] [flag]`: Create challenge code scaffolding. Issue number, name, category, and difficulty may be skipped if run in a channel with a linked challenge issue.
  - `update`: Update challenge
    - `name [name] [issue_number]`: Update challenge name. Issue number may be skipped if run in a channel with a linked challenge issue.
    - `status [status] [issue_number]`: Update challenge status. Issue number may be skipped if run in a channel with a linked challenge issue.
    - `difficulty [difficulty] [issue_number]`: Update challenge difficulty. Issue number may be skipped if run in a channel with a linked challenge issue.
    - `category [category] [issue_number]`: Update challenge category. Issue number may be skipped if run in a channel with a linked challenge issue.
  - `info [issue_number]`: Show challenge metadata. Issue number may be skipped if run in a channel with a linked challenge issue.
  - `reviews [author]`: List challenges with status `REVIEW_STATUS` (default `In Review`), optionally filtered by GitHub assignee username. Shows up to `REVIEW_LIMIT` challenges with links to GitHub and, if linked, the Discord channel.
  - `link_channel [issue_number]`: Link current channel to issue
  - `clear_channel`: Clear current channel mapping

## Persistence

Mapping state lives in `challenge_issues.json` (mounted volume in Docker: `/app/challenge_issues.json`).

Example structure:

```jsonc
{
  "challenges": {
    "123456789012345678": 42
  }
}
```

```

## Security

- Treat `DISCORD_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` as secrets; use Docker/K8s secret mounts.
- Limit GitHub token scopes (repo + project + workflow if needed; no admin).
- Rotate tokens periodically and audit usage.

> [!CAUTION]
> Privileged users can create repository issues, trigger workflows and mutate project status.
> Therefore, be cautious when assigning `DISCORD_ALLOWED_ROLES`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                 | Likely Cause                        | Resolution                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commands not visible    | Global sync delay                   | Provide `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` for scoped sync              |
| Labels not created      | Insufficient PAT scopes             | Ensure `repo` scope / correct fine-grained permissions  |
| Project status missing  | Wrong `GITHUB_PROJECT_ID`           | Confirm numeric project number; check debug logs        |
| Mapping not saved       | Volume not mounted or file perms    | Verify bind mount, container user permissions           |
| Workflow dispatch fails | Invalid workflow path / token perms | Check workflow name/path & `workflow` scope             |
| Authorization denied    | Role IDs mismatch                   | Confirm role IDs (not names) in `DISCORD_ALLOWED_ROLES` |
